I am a security researcher and hacking enthusiast. I was born in [Kunming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kunming), a city in China known for its eternal spring. Currently, I am pursuing a PhD under the supervision of [Prof. Wing Cheong Lau](https://staff.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~wclau/). Before that, I obtained BSc in Mathematics from the same university. 
My recent research interests are in mobile system and application (in)security, especially about authentication and authorization issues. Some of my works were published in academic conferences like USENIX and NDSS, and some were presented in hacking conferences like Black Hat. 

I have been a fan of CTF and bug bounty. From time to time, I wish I could have spent more time on them, be smarter, and be one of those cool kids. Except for not being cool enough, I'm pretty happy with my daily research and life. Finding vulnerabilities is what makes me most excited, and coding is what I usually do when I'm bored.
